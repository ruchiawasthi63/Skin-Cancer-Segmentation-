# Skin-Cancer-Segmentation-
Skin lesion segmentation for dermoscopic images has been an essential part of the automated medical diagnosis. Recently, advancements in deep learning techniques have led to the substantial increase in the accurate skin lesion segmentation process. However, there still lies a scope for meticulous improvement in the accuracies of these frameworks with the involvement of more annotated data and the existence of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) like deep structures. Owing to the above advancements, this method uses the recent innovations in the existing U-Net architecture. The effectiveness of the lesion segmentation is enhanced by integrating  atrous/dilated convolution layer on pre-processed input images which is further improved by commensurable post-processing techniques.
